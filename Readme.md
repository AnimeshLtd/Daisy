# Daisy

Daisy is a 16-bit computer equipped with a screen and a keyboard. It resembles
old school handheld computers like Gameboys, PDAs and mobile phones.

This project includes:
* a hardware platform,
* an assembler,
* a virtual machine,
* a programming language called DaisyScript,
* the DaisyScript compiler,
* a mini operating system written in DaisyScript

My goal for this project is to build a modern computer from scratch using first 
principles.
